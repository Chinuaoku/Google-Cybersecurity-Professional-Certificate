**TASK**


I've recently joined an e-commerce company as a cybersecurity analyst. The company has a unique setup where it stores its data on a remote database server, primarily because a significant portion of its workforce operates from various locations around the world. Employees regularly access this server to retrieve data for identifying potential customers. What's noteworthy is that this database has been accessible to the public since the company's inception three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I am acutely aware that leaving the database server open to the public presents a substantial vulnerability.

In light of this, I recognize the importance of conducting a vulnerability assessment to evaluate the risks associated with this situation. My objective is to effectively communicate these potential risks to the decision-makers within the company. To achieve this, I am tasked with preparing a written report that clearly articulates how the exposure of the server to the public poses a threat to our business operations and, more importantly, how this vulnerability can be mitigated and the server secured.

To conclude this task i did the following:

1. Reviewed information about the vulnerable server through the vulnerability assessment report

2. Performed a risk assessment by explaining the purpose of the information system, identifying potential threat sources, identified potential threat events and calculated the risk of potential threats.

3. I proposed a security recommendation by explaining my apprach and proposing a remediation strategy.
