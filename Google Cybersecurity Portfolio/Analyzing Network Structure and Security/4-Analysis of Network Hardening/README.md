**TASK**


As a security analyst at a social media organization, I found myself in the aftermath of a significant data breach that had compromised our customers' personal information, including their names and addresses. In response, our organization recognized the pressing need to establish robust network hardening practices to consistently shield against future attacks and breaches.

During my examination of the organization's network, I uncovered four substantial vulnerabilities:

1. Employees within the organization share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database remains set to the default.
3. The firewalls lack defined rules for filtering inbound and outbound network traffic.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not implemented.

If these vulnerabilities are left unaddressed, the organization remains vulnerable to potential data breaches and other security threats in the future.

In this exercise, I am tasked with crafting a security risk assessment to scrutinize the recent incident and outline potential methods for fortifying our network against such threats.

In the process, I went through my network hardening tools and selected the best ones for this situation. Also, i recommended security hardening practices to help prevent this type of incident from occuring again in the future. 

In my role as a security analyst, this task underscores my ability to pinpoint vulnerabilities, perform risk assessments, and suggest viable security solutions to tackle pivotal security challenges within an organization's network infrastructure. It exemplifies my unwavering dedication to advocating cybersecurity best practices and safeguarding sensitive data from potential threats.
