**TASK**


In my capacity as a cybersecurity analyst at a multimedia company that provides web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services to small businesses, I found myself dealing with a recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This incident disrupted our internal network for a duration of two hours before it was resolved.

During the attack, our network services abruptly ceased functioning due to a sudden influx of ICMP packets. Ordinary internal network traffic was unable to access any network resources. In response, the incident management team took action by blocking incoming ICMP packets, shutting down non-critical network services, and restoring critical network services.

Following the attack, the company's cybersecurity team conducted a thorough investigation. Their findings revealed that a malicious actor had inundated our network with ICMP pings by exploiting an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to orchestrate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, incapacitating our network.

To address this security incident, the network security team introduced the following measures:

1. Implementation of a new firewall rule to restrict the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
2. Introduction of source IP address verification on the firewall to identify spoofed IP addresses within incoming ICMP packets.
3. Deployment of network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
4. Incorporation of an Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter out certain ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

As a cybersecurity analyst, my role involves leveraging this security event to devise a comprehensive plan to enhance our company's network security. This plan adheres to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and encompasses the following key areas:

1. **Identify:** Identifying security risks through routine audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to uncover potential security gaps.

2. **Protect:** Safeguarding internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools aimed at mitigating cybersecurity threats.

3. **Detect:** Enhancing our capability to identify potential security incidents and bolstering monitoring systems to expedite detection.

4. **Respond:** Developing strategies to promptly contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, while concurrently making improvements to our overall security procedures.

5. **Recover:** Establishing protocols to restore affected systems to their normal operation and to recover any data or assets that may have been impacted during an incident.

Incorporating these NIST CSF guidelines, I will work to formulate a comprehensive security strategy to fortify our network against future cybersecurity threats.

Completing this task goes to demonstrate my competence in protecting networks against DDoS attacks, and my commitment to implementing strong security measures to protect sensitive digital assets.
