**TASK**


In my role as a security professional within a large organization, my primary focus is on collaborating with the research team. A significant aspect of my responsibilities involves ensuring that the users within this team are appropriately authorized with the necessary permissions. This proactive approach plays a pivotal role in maintaining the overall security of our systems.

My current task involves a meticulous examination of the existing permissions within the file system. The goal is to assess whether these permissions align with the prescribed authorizations. In cases where disparities are identified, it becomes imperative to make necessary adjustments to the permissions. This includes authorizing the rightful users while concurrently revoking access for any unauthorized individuals.

This task showcases my profciency in Linux, and my ability to manage file permissions. I have included in the report attached here screenshots, commands i used and the reason(s).
