**TASK**

In the course of this program, I understood the importance of drafting my own professional statement, in order to showcase myself, skills, interests and aspirations to potential employers and partners. Here i will demonstrate how i was able to complete this task.

First, I examined myself and outlined my strengths, and those that I am committed to developing over time.

Secondly, I considered my core values in cybersecurity, and how they will help me to mitigate threats, risks and vulnerabilities in the course of my career. Also, it highlights how I will abide by the codes and ethics that ensure best practices.

Thirdly, I asked myself clarifying questions to highlight my interests in the cybersecurity industry. I also put into consideration anyone who may potentially read my professional statement so that i can present myself properly and honestly to them. 

Lastly, I put into thought how my strengths, values and interests will impact positively on whoever I eventually work with. 

As I gain more skills and experience, I will update my professional statement from time to time.
