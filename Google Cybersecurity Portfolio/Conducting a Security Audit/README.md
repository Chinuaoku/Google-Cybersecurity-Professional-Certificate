**TASK: BOTIUM TOYS**


Botium Toys, a small U.S. enterprise specializing in toy development and sales, operates from a single physical location. Nonetheless, its online presence has flourished, drawing in customers from both the United States and international markets. As a result, the company's Information Technology (IT) department faces mounting pressure to provide global support for their online market.

Recognizing the need for a concrete plan to ensure business continuity and compliance with the company's expansion, the IT department manager opted to initiate an internal IT audit. She expressed concerns regarding the absence of a well-defined strategy for safeguarding the organization's infrastructure and addressing potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. Additionally, the manager was keen on ensuring the company's adherence to regulations governing online payment acceptance and business operations within the European Union (E.U.).

To kickstart the audit process, the IT manager took several key steps, including implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), defining the audit's scope and objectives, and completing a comprehensive risk assessment. The primary aim of this audit was to provide an in-depth assessment of the potential risks that the company might encounter given its existing security posture. Subsequently, the IT manager intended to leverage the audit findings as supporting evidence for securing approval to expand the department.

I was entrusted with the responsibility of reviewing the IT manager's scope, objectives, and risk assessment, followed by the execution of an internal audit to complete a thorough controls assessment and compliance checklist.
