**TASK: AUDIT BOTIUM TOYS**


Botium Toys, a small U.S. enterprise specializing in toy development and sales, operates from a single physical location. Nonetheless, its online presence has flourished, drawing in customers from both the United States and international markets. As a result, the company's Information Technology (IT) department faces mounting pressure to provide global support for their online market.

Recognizing the need for a concrete plan to ensure business continuity and compliance with the company's expansion, the IT department manager opted to initiate an internal IT audit. She expressed concerns regarding the absence of a well-defined strategy for safeguarding the organization's infrastructure and addressing potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. Additionally, the manager was keen on ensuring the company's adherence to regulations governing online payment acceptance and business operations within the European Union (E.U.).

To kickstart the audit process, the IT manager took several key steps, including implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), defining the audit's scope and objectives, and completing a comprehensive risk assessment. The primary aim of this audit was to provide an in-depth assessment of the potential risks that the company might encounter given its existing security posture. Subsequently, the IT manager intended to leverage the audit findings as supporting evidence for securing approval to expand the department.

I was entrusted with the responsibility of reviewing the IT manager's scope, objectives, and risk assessment, followed by the execution of an internal audit to complete a thorough controls assessment and compliance checklist.

To move ahead, I collaborated with the IT manager to considere and establish the elements of the internal audit. It included establishing the scope and goals of the audit, conducting a risk assessment of the organization's assets, completing a controls assessment, assessing compliance, and communicating results to stakeholders.

**Audit Scope**: 
The IT audit assessed current user permissions, implemented controls, procedures and protocols, and compliance level.

**Audit Goal**:
The goals was to ensure adherence to NIST CSF, establish a better process for the system to ensure compliance, harden controls, implement the concept of least permission, establish policies and procedures and ensure that regulatory requirements are met. 

**Risk Assessment**:
This was focused on identifying potential threats, risks and vulnerabilities in the entire system. It helped us to determine what security measures should be implemented and monitered to ensure asset safety. We also considered the complaince regulations that must be put in place. 

**Controls Assessment**:
Here, we reviewed Botium's existing assets and the potential risks they face. This helped us to determine whether internal controls were effective or not. We did this by assessing the administrative controls which includes the human component of cybersecurity, technical controls which are the software and hardware such as IDS and IPS used in protecting assets, and physical control which involves preventing physical access to protected assets. 

**Compliance Checklist**: 
Compliance was important to Botium Toys because of its international presence and their online payment processing. I developed a checklist and we evaluated its compliance posture, especislly whether they were meeting the GDPR and PCI DSS requirements. This helped to determine areas of non-compliance and an idea of should be done. 

**Documentation and Report**: 
In the final stage of the audit, I was able to put together all my findings in a comprehensive and concise report. I clearly communinated the top leafership of Botium Toys their current cybersecurity posture and the areas that require improvement. This served as a guide to enhance their overall security posture. 


This project had a dual impact, not only elevating the security and compliance standards of Botium Toys but also enabling the growth of the IT department. Through its alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a comprehensive risk assessment, and the delivery of practical recommendations for controls assessment and compliance, the project effectively showcased the importance of proactive cybersecurity practices in protecting vital assets, ensuring uninterrupted business operations, and facilitating worldwide expansion.
